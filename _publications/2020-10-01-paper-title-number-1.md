excerpt: 'In this work, we leverage domain-knowledge in defining positive and negative pairs in the contrasting strategy that leverage structural similarity across medical volumes. Additionally, we devise a local contrastive loss (problem-specific cue) lo learn distinctive local-level representations useful for segmentation tasks. We found leveraging both domain and problem-specific cues in pre-training the network lead to substantial gains over baseline, pre-training with default contrastive loss, compared self-supervision and semi-supervised learning approaches.'
