excerpt: 'In this work, we propose contrasting strategies to leverage domain-specific cues in defining positive and negative pairs to leverage structural similarity across medical volumes. We also devise a local contrastive loss (problem-specific cue) lo learn distinctive local-level representations useful for segmentation tasks. The proposed pre-training lead to substantial improvements compared to baseline, pre-training with contrastive loss without domain cues, compared self-supervision and semi-supervised learning approaches.'
