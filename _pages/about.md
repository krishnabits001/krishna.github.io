I am a Doctoral (PhD) student at ETH Zurich in the Compuer Vision Lab under the supervision of Prof. Ender Konukoglu.


Research Area
======
Humans can generalize to any given new task with few examples while current deep learning algorithms suffer from requiring large number of annotations to yield good performance.
This problem is more relevant for deep learning algorithms applied on Medical Image Analysis tasks. 
As obtaining large datasets and corresponding annotations for each new task from clinical experts in expensive, time-consuming and not practical for deployment.
My research focus is to solve this problem and achieve high performance with deep learning algorithms using few annotations for medical imaging tasks.
The major research topics are: (a) Self-supervised learning, (b) Data Augmentation, (c) Semi-supervised learning.

Bio
======
I have done my B.Tech in Electronics and Communications from BITS-Pilani Hyderabad Campus (2008-2012).
