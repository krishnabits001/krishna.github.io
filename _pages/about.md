<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>

I am pursuing my Doctoral (PhD) degree under the supervision of Prof. Ender Konukoglu with BioMedical Image Computing (BMIC(https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/research.html)) group in the Compuer Vision Lab, ETH Zurich.


Research Area
======
Humans can generalize to any given new task with few examples, while current deep learning algorithms do not generalize with few labels and require a large number of annotations to yield high performance.
This problem is more relevant for deep learning algorithms applied to medical image analysis tasks. 
For medical imaging, obtaining large datasets and corresponding annotations for each new task from clinical experts is expensive and time-consuming, and not a preferable solution in clinical settings.

My research focus is to solve this problem and achieve high performance with deep learning algorithms using few annotations while leveraging unlabeled data for medical imaging tasks.
My research directions are (a) Self-supervised learning, (b) Data Augmentation, (c) Semi-supervised learning.

Bio
======
I have done my B.Tech in Electronics and Communications from BITS-Pilani Hyderabad, India (2008-2012).
After my bacherlors, I have worked for 3 years as Digital Design Engineer in Intel and NXP Semiconductors on RTL design and verification (2012-2015).
Post that, I have been ETH Zurich where I pursued my Masters in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering from 2015-2017.
Later from 2017, I countinued with my PhD degree at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Ender Konukoglu.
